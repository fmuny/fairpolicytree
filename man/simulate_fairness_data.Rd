\title{Simulate Artificial Fairness Data}
\usage{
simulate_fairness_data(n = 1000, seed = 123456)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of observations to generate. Default is 1000.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 123456.}
}
\value{
A list with three data.frames:
  \describe{
    \item{sens}{Data frame with two binary sensitive attributes.}
    \item{decision}{Data frame with one binary and one continuous decision variable.}
    \item{scores}{Data frame with two continuous policy score variables.}
  }
}
\description{
Generates artificial data with:
- Two binary sensitive attributes (correlated)
- One binary and one continuous decision variable (both correlated with sensitive attributes)
- Two continuous policy score variables (correlated with all other variables)
}
